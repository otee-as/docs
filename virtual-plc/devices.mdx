## Onboarding / Installing a Device

Deploying an OTee vPLC to your setup requires a hardware device on your network from which it can be run. This could be an existing, physical and open PLC, or any off-the-shelf hardware that fulfils the system requirements (see below).

<Info>

System requirements for devices hosting OTee vPLCs: 

* Linux OS

* Internet connection and open 7422 port (outbound)

* Sufficient CPU and memory to support the intended control logic and cycle times (for small projects, pretty much any machine will do! - Note that if you're using the Free Tier, your device needs to have at least 2GB of disk space and 1GB of RAM available)

* CURL and tar installed on the OS

* Docker and ‘docker compose’ (v2 or higher) installed on the OS (see next info box below)

* Current user needs to be part of the Docker user group (or use sudo)

To add your own user to the Docker user group, run this command:

```
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
// now logout and login.
```

Optional:

* Ethernet port (for connecting to remote I/O)

* The following chip architectures of target devices are currently supported:

* ARM32, ARM64, x86_64

* Follow any of the above links and find more Linux distributions in the side navigation panel

</Tip>

Switch to the device tab on the main navigation in the app’s header.

Hit the plus sign to start the onboarding of a new device. In the “Onboard device” modal, name your device and add a description (optional). It is important that you select the correct chip architecture for your device form the drop-down.

Proceeding will then create a CURL command for you to copy and run from your host device’s terminal. This will install an OTee device agent and the latest available OTee runtime version on your machine - your first virtual PLC is born!

## Troubleshooting

Once the installation on your host device is complete, verify that the agent is running by executing the following command (replace &lt;your-device-name&gt; with the name you have chosen during the onboarding process):

`docker logs -f agent-agent_<your-device-name>`

This command will display the logs of the running agent, informing whether it has been successfully installed. Next, you may produce the logs for the publish-subscribe component on your device, by running the following command (replace &lt;your-device-name&gt; with the name you have chosen during the onboarding process):

`docker logs -f nats-nats_<your-device-name>`

If you're detecting any errors in these logs, send them over to your friends at OTee or reach out to the community via OTee's Discord server.

## Offboarding / Uninstalling a Device

To remove all OTee components from your device, the following command can be executed in the terminal (bash).

Paste and run the following script:

```bash lines
# Delete containers based on image name
docker ps -a --format '{{.ID}} {{.Image}}' | awk '$2 ~ /nats:|otee/ {print $1}' | xargs -r docker rm -f && \
# Delete images based on repository:tag
docker images --format '{{.Repository}}:{{.Tag}} {{.ID}}' | awk '$1 ~ /nats:|otee/ {print $2}' | xargs -r docker rmi -f && \
# Clean up unused networks (including non OTee networks)
docker network prune -f
```

In the OTee user interface, navigate to the Devices page and select the device you want to remove. he device by hitting the “Delete device” button on your device’s page.
