title: "Onboard a Device"
description: "Deploying an OTee vPLC to your setup requires a hardware device on your network from which it can be run. This could be an existing, physical and open PLC, or any off-the-shelf hardware that fulfils the system requirements (see below). "

<Info>

System requirements for devices hosting OTee vPLCs: 

* Linux OS

* Internet connection and open 7422 port (outbound)

* Sufficient CPU and memory to support the intended control logic and cycle times (for small projects, pretty much any machine will do! - Note that if you're using the Free Tier, your device needs to have at least 2GB of disk space and 1GB of RAM available)

* CURL and tar installed on the OS

* Docker and ‘docker compose’ (v2 or higher) installed on the OS (see next info box below)

* Current user needs to be part of the Docker user group (or use sudo)

To add your own user to the Docker user group, run this command:

```
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
// now logout and login.
```

Optional:

* Ethernet port (for connecting to remote I/O)

* The following chip architectures of target devices are currently supported:

* ARM32, ARM64, x86_64

* Follow any of the above links and find more Linux distributions in the side navigation panel

</Tip>

Switch to the device tab on the main navigation in the app’s header.

Hit the plus sign to start the onboarding of a new device. In the “Onboard device” modal, name your device and add a description (optional). It is important that you select the correct chip architecture for your device form the drop-down.

Proceeding will then create a CURL command for you to copy and run from your host device’s terminal. This will install an OTee device agent and the latest available OTee runtime version on your machine - your first virtual PLC is born!
