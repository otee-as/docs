OTee is all about openness, so any code produced on the platform can be exported for further processing in any IEC 61131 compliant application. To get you started quickly, we'll import such a project file in this step.

Start by downloading our example project, which uses a function block to simulate a heat exchanger and a built-in PID controller to steer the process towards the user's target temperature set point.

<a href="/heat_exchanger.xml" download="heat_exchanger.xml" icon="download"> Download demo project file</a>

If you’re not already there, switch to the projects tab in the app’s main navigation. While empty at first, you’ll see a list of all your existing projects within your organization to which you have at least viewing permission. 

To import an existing project, hit the <Icon icon="download" iconType="solid" /> button and select the XML project file you've just downloaded. A successful import will take you to the editor - your main user interface for programming, managing and deploying control logic to your virtual PLC (vPLC).

You can use this demo project to make yourself familiar with the editor and the various building blocks that together make a control system project in IEC 61131. You'll also find detailed explanations on all things project in the OTee User Documentation. But for the sake of this quick start guide, let's jump to the next step and get the project deployed to your very own virtual PLC.
