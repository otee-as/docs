If you’re not already there, switch to the projects tab in the app’s main navigation. While empty at first, you’ll see a list of allyour existing projects within your organization to which you have at least viewing permission. 

To import a new project from scratch, hit the “(+) Create a Project” button and give it a name. This will take you to the editor - your main user interface for programming, managing and deploying control logic to your virtual PLC (vPLC).
